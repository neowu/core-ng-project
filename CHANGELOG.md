## Change log

### 9.0.4 (12/20/2023 - )

### 9.0.3 (12/12/2023 - 12/19/2023)

* kafka: updated client to 3.6.1
* db: tweaked datetime related operations for virtual thread
  > use new date api if possible, mysql driver uses too many locks/sync for old Date/Timestamp impl
  > it recommends to map MySQL column type: LocalDate -> DATE, LocalDateTime -> DATETIME(6), ZonedDateTime -> TIMESTAMP(6)
  > with Timestamp, in mysql console, it is easier to use "SET @@session.time_zone" to adjust datetime value displayed
* mysql: updated mysql driver according to profiling result
  > use "core.framework.mysql:mysql-connector-j:8.2.0-r2"
  > simplified and tuned used code path

### 9.0.2 (12/7/2023 - 12/12/2023)

* stats: dump virtual threads on high cpu
* http: response "connection: keep-alive" header if client sends keep-alive header
  > to be compatible with http/1.0 client, like ab (apache benchmark) with "-k"
* mysql: patched mysql jdbc driver to support virtual thread and gcloud auth
  > use "core.framework.mysql:mysql-connector-j:8.2.0"
  > !!! for db-migration, pls continue to use "com.mysql:mysql-connector-j:8.2.0", as our patched version may remove unused features
  > refer to https://github.com/neowu/mysql-connector-j
  > refer to https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=110512

### 9.0.1 (12/01/2023 - 12/7/2023)

* thread: updated default virtual thread scheduler parallelism to at least 16
  > jdbc is not fully supported virtual thread yet, allow more virtual thread unfriendly tasks to run parallel
  > refer to https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=110512
* kafka: updated kafka listener to virtual thread, increased default concurrency to cpu * 16
  > now only 1 thread is pulling messages, and dispatched to {concurrency} threads

* search: update es to 8.6.0

### 8.0.10 (12/13/2022 - 01/04/2023)

* log: remove APP_LOG_FILTER_CONFIG from log-processor
  > not really useful in practice, log system should be designed to be capable of persisting massive data
* db: updated pool.maxIdleTime from 1 hour to 2 hours
  > with cloud auth, metadata service could be down during GKE control plane updating (zonal GKE only, not regional GKE)
  > increase maxIdleTime will hold db connection longer and improve efficiency of db pool, especially in cloud env, there is no firewall between app and db
* mongo: update driver to 4.8.1

### 8.0.8 (10/10/2022 - 11/09/2022)

* ext: update log-collector default sys.http.maxForwardedIPs to 2
  > to keep consistent with framework default values, use ENV to override if needed
* http: if x-forwarded-for header has more ip than maxForwardedIPs, put x-forwarded-for in action log context
  > for request passes thru http forward proxy, or x-forwarded-for spoofing, log complete chain for troubleshooting
* http: handle http request with empty path
  > browser or regular http client won't send empty path, only happens with raw http request sending by low level client
* http: update undertow to 2.3.0
* db: update mysql driver to 8.0.31
  > mysql maven group updated, it is 'com.mysql:mysql-connector-j:8.0.31'

  > es 8.5.0 has bug to break monitor, https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/91259, fixed by 8.5.3

### 8.0.7 (09/23/2022 - 10/05/2022)

* ext: updated dockerfile for security compliance
  > in order to enable kube "securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true", docker image should use numeric user (UID)
* monitor: fixed kafka high disk alert message
  > kafka disk usage uses size as threshold, alert message should convert to percentage
* log-processor: support action log trace filter
  > to filter out trace to reduce storage, e.g. under massive scanning
* kafka: update to 3.3.1
  > kraft mode is production ready

### 8.0.6 (08/16/2022 - 09/23/2022)

* log-processor: always use bulk index, to simplify
  > ES already unified bulk index / single index thread pool, there is only one "write" pool
  > refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-threadpool.html
* http: update undertow to 2.2.19
* search: update es to 8.4.1
* db: support json column via @Column(json=true)
  > syntax sugar to simplify custom getter and setter to convert between String column and Bean
* kafka: update to 3.2.3
* mongo: json @Property should not be used on mongo entity class
  > same like db, view and entity should be separated
* db: mysql jdbc driver updated to 8.0.30

### 8.0.5 (07/28/2022 - 08/15/2022)

* mock: fixed MockRedis.list().range(), with negative start or stop
  > only impact unit test
* mongo: update driver to 4.7.1
* kafka: update to 3.2.1
* kafka: removed KafkaConfig.publish(messageClass) without topic support
  > it proved not useful to support dynamic topic, topic better be designed like table, prefer static naming / typing over dynamic
  > if really need something like request/replay, fan-in / fan-out pattern, still can be implemented in explicit way
* monitor: monitoring kafka topic/message type changes
* mongo: improve entity decoding
  > use switch to replace if on field matching

### 8.0.4 (07/10/2022 - 07/27/2022)

* log-collector: stricter request validation
* mongo: add connection pool stats metrics
* db: add experimental postgresql support
  > many new db products use postgres compatible driver, e.g. GCloud AlloyDB, CockroachDB
  > PostgreSQL lacks of many features we are using with MySQL, 1. affected rows, 2. QueryInterceptor to track no index used sql
* search: clear ForEach scroll once process done
* http: update undertow to 2.2.18
* search: update es to 8.3.2
* kafka: mark LONG_CONSUMER_DELAY as error if delay is longer than 15 mins
  > currently MAX_POLL_INTERVAL_MS_CONFIG = 30 mins, larger delay will trigger rebalance and message resending
  > system should be designed to process polling messages fast

### 8.0.3 (06/22/2022 - 07/08/2022)

* mongo: update driver to 4.6.0
* warning: removed @DBWarning, replaced with @IOWarning
  > e.g. @IOWarning(operation="db", maxOperations=2000, maxElapsedInMs=5000, maxReads=2000, maxTotalReads=10_000, maxTotalWrites=10_000)
* kafka: updated default long consumer delay threshold from 60s to 30s
* mongo: supports BigDecimal (map to mongo Decimal128 type)
* mongo: supports LocalDate (map to String)
* monitor: for critical errors, use 1 min as timespan (only send one alert message per min for same kind error)
  > in reality, ongoing critical error may flush slack channel, 1 min timespan is good enough to bring attention, and with lesser messages
* redis: supports SortedSet.remove()

### 8.0.2 (06/02/2022 - 06/17/2022) !!! @DBWarning is replaced with @IOWarning on 8.0.3, better upgrade to next version

* db: redesign db max operations, removed Database.maxOperations(), introduced @DBWarning
  > one service may mix multiple type of workload, some could be async and call db many times while others API needs to be sync and responsive
  > with new design, it allows to specify warning threshold in granular level
  > currently @DBWarning only support Controller/WS method, MessageHandler method, and executor task inherits from parent @DBWarning
* db: reduced default LONG_TRANSACTION threshold from 10s to 5s, log commit/rollback elapsed time

### 8.0.0 (05/19/2022 - 05/31/2022)  !!! breaking changes

* json: expose JSONMapper.builder() method to allow app create its own JSON parser
  > e.g. to parse external json with custom DeserializationFeature/MapperFeature
* search: add validation, document class must not have default values
  > with partialUpdate, it could override es with those default values
* search: update and partialUpdate return if target doc is updated
  > refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update.html#_detect_noop_updates
* log-processor: action forward supports ignoring actions
* db: query.count() and query.projectOne() honor sort/skip/limit   !!! behavior changed !!!
  > repository.select() is designed to be syntax sugar, to make it easier to construct single table SQL (ORM is not design goal)
  > since it supports groupBy() projectOne() project(), now we removed all customized rules, it degraded to plain SQL builder
  > if you uses query.count(), it's better not set skip/limit/orderBy before that
  > with this, projection works as intended, e.g. query.limit(1); query.projectOne("col1, col2", View.class); results in "select col1, col2 from table limit 1"

### 7.10.8 (05/16/2022 - 05/19/2022)

* log-processor: action forward supports by result
  > e.g. only forward OK actions
* json: disabled ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS, to make it stricter
  > thru JSONMapper.disable(MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS)
  > previously, [""] will convert [null] if target type is List<Integer>
* search: put detailed error in SearchException
* kafka: update to 3.2.0
* db: query.project() renamed to query.projectOne(), added query.project() to return List<View> !!!
  > should be easy to fix with compiler errors

### 7.10.7 (04/29/2022 - 05/12/2022)

* log-collector: make http().maxForwardedIPs() read property "sys.http.maxForwardedIPs"
  > so it can be configured by env
* stats: replace cpu usage with JDK built-in OperatingSystemMXBean.getProcessCpuLoad()
  > since jdk 17, java is aware of container, refer to https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/04/19/java-17-whats-new-openjdks-container-awareness
* rate-limit: update rate control config api to make it more intuitive
  > e.g. add("group", 10, 5, Duration.ofSeconds(1)) keeps 10 permits at most, fills 5 permits every second
  > e.g. add("group", 20, 10, Duration.ofMinutes(5)) keeps 20 permits at most, fills 10 permits every 5 minutes
* search: added retryOnConflict on UpdateRequest to handle
* search: added partialUpdate
* db: mysql jdbc driver updated to 8.0.29 !!! framework depends on mysql api, must use matched jdbc driver
* search: update es to 8.2.0

### 7.10.6 (04/19/2022 - 04/28/2022)

* db: tweak gcloud iam auth provider expiration time, make CancelQueryTaskImpl be aware of gcloud auth provider
* db: tweak query timeout handling
  > increase db socket timeout, to make MySQL cancel timer (CancelQueryTaskImpl) has more room to kill query
* http: update undertow to 2.2.17
  > UNDERTOW-2041 Error when X-forwarded-For header contains ipv6 address with leading zeroes
  > UNDERTOW-2022 FixedLengthStreamSourceConduit must overwrite resumeReads
* monitor: collect ES cpu usage
  > added highCPUUsageThreshold in monitor es config
* httpClient: verify hostname with trusting specific cert !!! behavior changed, check carefully
  > previously, HTTPClient.builder().trust(CERT) will use empty hostname verifier
  > now, only trustAll() will bypass hostname verifying, so right now if you trust specific cert, make sure you have CN/ALT_NAME matches the dns name (wildcard domain name also works)
* httpClient: retry aware of maxProcessTime
  > for short circuit, e.g. heavy load request causes remote service busy, and client timeout triggers more retry requests, to amplify the load
* es: support refresh on bulk request
  > to specify whether auto refresh after bulk request
* es: added timeout in search/complete request
* es: added DeleteByQuery
* es: added perf trace for elasticSearch.refreshIndex
* monitor: treat high disk usage as error
  > disk full requires immediate attention to expand
* action: use id as correlationId for root action
  > to make kibana search easier, e.g. search by correlationId will list all actions
  > log-processor action diagram also simplified

### 7.10.5 (04/01/2022 - 04/14/2022)

* search: truncate es request log
  > bulk index request body can be huge, to reduce heap usage
* db: support gcloud IAM auth
  > gcloud mysql supported IAM service account auth, to use access token instead of user/password
  > set db user to "iam/gcloud" to use gcloud iam auth
* monitor: add retry on kube client
  > to reduce failures when kube cluster upgrades by cloud
* http: removed http().httpPort() and http().httpsPort(), replaced with http().listenHTTP(host) and http().listenHTTPS(host)
  > replaced sys.http.port, sys.https.port with sys.http.listen and sys.https.listen
  > host are in "host:port" format, e.g. 127.0.0.1:8080 or 8080 (equivalent to 0.0.0.0:8080)
  > with cloud env, all envs have same dns/service name, so to simplify properties config, it's actually better to setup dns name to minic cloud in local
  > e.g. set "customer-service" to 127.0.0.2 in local dns, and hardcode "https://customer-service" as customerServiceURL
* log-collector: refer to above, use sys.http.listen and sys.https.listen env if needed
* kafka: redesigned /_sys/ controller, now they are /_sys/kafka/topic/:topic/key/:key/publish and /_sys/kafka/topic/:topic/key/:key/handle
  > publish is to publish message to kafka, visible to all consumers
  > handle is to handle the message on the current pod, not visible to kafka, just call handler to process the message (manual recovery or replay message)

### 7.10.4 (03/15/2022 - 03/31/2022)

* maven: deleted old published version older than 7.9.0
* redis: replaced ZRANGEBYSCORE with ZRANGE, requires redis 6.2 !!!
* redis: for list.pop always use "LPOP count" to simplify, requires redis 6.2 !!!
* redis: added RedisSortedSet.popMin
* redis: improved RedisSortedSet.popByScore concurrency handling
* kafka: collect producer kafka_request_size_max, collect kafka_max_message_size
  > stats.kafka_request_size_max is from kafka producer metrics, which is compressed size (include key/value/header/protocol),
  > broker size config "message.max.bytes" should be larger than this
  > action.stats.kafka_max_message_size is uncompressed size of value bytes, (kafka().maxRequestSize() should be larger than this)
* log-processor: added stat-kafka_max_message_size vis, added to kafka dashboard
* log-processor: updated stat-kafka_request_size vis, added max request size
* log: limit max size of actionLog.context() to 5000 for one key
  > warn with "CONTEXT_TOO_LARGE" if too many context values
* log: tweaked action log/trace truncation
  > increased max request size to 2M
  > check final action log json bytes before sending to log-kafka, if it's more than 2M, print log to console, and truncate context/trace
  > with snappy compression, it's generally ok with broker message.max.bytes=1M
  > in worst case, we can set log-kafka message.max.bytes=2M
  > will review the current setup and potentially adjust in future

### 7.10.3 (02/25/2022 - 03/14/2022)

* db: fix: revert previous update UNEXPECTED_UPDATE_RESULT warning if updated row is 0
* executor: log task class in trace to make it easier to find the corresponding code of executor task
* log-processor: update action-* context dynamic index template to support dot in context key
  > it's not recommended putting dot in action log context key
* log-processor: kibana json updated for kibana 8.1.0
  > TSVB metrics separate left axis bug fixed, so to revert GC diagrams back
* search: update es to 8.1.0
  > > BTW: ES cannot upgrade a node from version [7.14.0] directly to version [8.1.0], upgrade to version [7.17.0] first.
* mongo: updated driver to 4.5.0
  > removed mapReduce in favor of aggregate, it's deprecated by mongo 5.0  
  > refer to https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/mapReduce/#mapreduce

### 7.10.2 (02/11/2022 - 02/23/2022)

* scheduler: replaced jobExecutor with unlimited cached thread pool
  > no impact with regular cases, normally scheduler-service in one application should only send kafka message
  > this change is mainly to simplify test service or non-global jobs (e.g. no need to put real logic to Executors in Job)
* jre: published neowu/jre:17.0.2
* search: update es to 8.0.0
  > Elastic dropped more modules from this version, now we have to include transport-netty4, mapper-extras libs
  > and it doesn't provide standard way of integration test, refer to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/55258
  > opensearch is doing opposite, https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.opensearch.plugin
* db: updated batchInsertIgnore, batchUpsert, batchDelete return value from boolean[] to boolean
  > this is drawback of MySQL thin driver, though expected behavior
  > with batch insert ignore (or insert on duplicate key), MySQL thin driver fills entire affectedRows array with same value, java.sql.Statement.SUCCESS_NO_INFO if updated count > 0
  > refer to com.mysql.cj.jdbc.ClientPreparedStatement.executeBatchedInserts Line 758
  > if you need to know result for each entity, you have to use single operation one by one (Transaction may help performance a bit)
* db: mysql jdbc driver updated to 8.0.28
  > one bug fixed: After calling Statement.setQueryTimeout(), when a query timeout was reached, a connection to the server was established to terminate the query,
  > but the connection remained open afterward. With this fix, the new connection is closed after the query termination. (Bug #31189960, Bug #99260)
* known bugs:
  > db, due to use affected rows (not found rows), if repository updates entity without any change, it warns with UNEXPECTED_UPDATE_RESULT, please ignore this, will fix in next version
