* search: update es to 8.15.0
* tweak search query builder !!! breaking API change, just fix compiler error
  > to construct SearchRequest.query, use one of following

!!! okIO issue
https://github.com/square/okio/commit/f8434f575787198928a26334758ddbca9726b11c#diff-f63e8920e14cc4bf376a495cfcd1fbfa2eee7bbcdfec0ad10f2bc51237c59725
for some reason, Http2Writer.flush (synchronized) -> AsyncTimeout$Companion.cancelScheduledTimeout (changed to reentrantLock)
triggered VirtualThreads.park, make all other virtual threads which share same http2connection deadlocked

  > azure mysql flexible server supports IAM service account auth, to use access token instead of user/password
  > set db user to "iam/azure" to use azure iam auth
* search: update es to 8.12.0, switch es module repo to codelibs
  > !!! integration test breaks with JDK 21.0.2 (even with old version of es lib), refer to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/104347
  > !!! to run with JDK 21.0.2, workaround is to create EsExecutors.java and apply the fix locally
  > !!! add codelib maven repo to project

```kotlin
maven {
    url = uri("https://maven.codelibs.org/")
    content {
        includeGroup("org.codelibs.elasticsearch.module")

  > use "core.framework.mysql:mysql-connector-j:8.2.0"
  > !!! for db-migration, pls continue to use "com.mysql:mysql-connector-j:8.2.0", as our patched version may remove unused features
