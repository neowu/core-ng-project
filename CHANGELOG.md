## Change log

### 7.6.10 (01/18/2021 - )

* api: for max process time, webservice will consider both http client timeout and remaining process time of current action
* monitor: support multiple alert channels
* es: update to 7.10.2
* http: collect http server active requests to reflect how many active requests are in process (to analyze performance with cpu usage, worker thread pool size and etc)

### 7.6.9 (01/04/2021 - 01/15/2021)

* contentType: according to RFC and iana, application/json should not have charset, and use utf8 as default charset.
  > refer to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-8.1, https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/json
* http: introduced HTTPConfig.maxProcessTime(), to specify client timeout or cloud lb backend timeout,
  > for default value, http uses 30s for initial request, kafka listener uses 30mins for whole polled batch.
  > maxProcessTime will be passed to subsequent sync action thru "timeout" http header, via WebServiceClient
  > http client retry will consider time left from max process time
  > action will check for slow process if took more than 80% max process time
* http: added HTTPConfig.maxEntitySize(), to specify max body size and multipart file upload size

### 7.6.8 (12/21/2020 - 12/30/2020)

* executor: improved future.get(), report both action and id on exception, to help troubleshooting

### 7.5.8 (09/03/2020 - 09/07/2020)

* api: WebServiceClientInterceptor will process onResponse before validateResponse, let interceptor see error http response as well
* es: update to 7.9.1
* inject: check if any bean has @Inject field but not autowired e.g. someone may pass a manually created object into api().service(), but later someone else may add @Inject field in serviceImpl and failed to realize bind() was not used

### 7.5.7 (08/30/2020 - 09/03/2020)

* json: disable to deserialize ordinal number to enum (the default setting of jackson is not strict)
* api: use generic error message when webservice client or controller failed to deserialize json
  !!! not to leak too much internal info to public, e.g. jackson return all possible enums in error message.
* httpClient: HTTPClient.builder().trust(CERT) to add system trusted issuers as well
* stats: collect cpu usage after the startup, to ignore high cpu usage during startup

### 7.5.5 (08/24/2020 - 08/30/2020)

* stats: updated cpu usage calculation to support docker (overhead improved compare to previous impl which used threading time)
  !!! due to within java, there is no way to get exact cpu shares, in kube env, better to put cpu limit as integer, like 1000m or 2000m
  !!! to keep it simple, retrieve available cpu count by java API (Runtime.getAvailableProcessors()), and not going hard way e.g. read "/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.shares".
* stats: collect thread dump via stats.info if cpu usage is high
* httpClient: support request level connectTimeout and timeout (read/write)
* log: unified BytesLogParam and JSONLogParam, to make cache returned log maskable

### 7.5.4 (07/31/2020 - 08/24/2020)

* kafka: rollback kafka java client to 2.4.1
  !!! https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10134 is not fully fixed.
* es: update to 7.9.0
* monitor: support more flexible notification config, allow notifying certain slack channel based on matching criteria
  !!! pls update monitor config similar like

```json
{
  "ignoreErrors": [
    {"apps": ["website"], "errorCodes": ["PATH_NOT_FOUND"], "severity": "WARN"}
  ],
  "criticalErrors": [
    {"errorCodes": ["FAILED_TO_START", "POD_FAILURE"]}
  ],
  "kibanaURL": "http://kibana:5601",
  "channels": {
    "actionWarnChannel": {"severity": "WARN", "indices": ["trace", "stat"]},
    "actionErrorChannel": {"severity": "ERROR", "indices": ["trace", "stat"]},
    "eventWarnChannel": {"severity": "WARN", "indices": ["event"]},
    "eventErrorChannel": {"severity": "ERROR", "indices": ["event"]},
    "additionalErrorCodeChannel": {"apps": ["product-service"], "errorCodes": ["PRODUCT_ERROR"]}
  }
}
```    

* db: disallow single quote (') in sql, this is to enforce prepared statement, not allowing concat string values indirectly into dynamic sql
  !!! make sure to review all exiting usages, query.where(), database.select()/execute() etc,
  !!! this also disallows function usage, like IFNULL(column, 'default'), but in our design, we prefer to simplify in first place, by either saving exact needed data, or handle in java code
* db: query.where(condition) enclose the condition with parentheses if it has OR operator
* monitor: added es_gc stats for es monitor
* monitor: added kafka monitor (heap/gc/network), and kibana visualizations
* stats: tweak kibana field format, update kibana bytes fields with better formatting
* stats: simplify stats key for jvm_gc and es_gc update consumer_lag_in_ms to nanoseconds                  
  !!! pls use same version of monitor/log-processor and framework.
* test: added mockito builtin MockitoExtension via mockito-junit-jupiter, removed framework one
  !!! old org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this) is deprecated, use @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
* redis: update redis config to support different port other than 6379 potentially to use Envoy as redis proxy, by considering the future of service mesh and isito development refer to https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/other_protocols/redis#arch-overview-redis
  it does not support SCAN/PUBSUB command yet, so the usage is kind of limited. e.g. partition redis db, or remote only cache other options are like managed redis service, e.g. gcloud memorystore the official one moves slowly, https://github.com/RedisLabs/redis-cluster-proxy
* cache: cache config api changed
  !!! replace cache().local() cache().remote() back to cache().add()
  !!! for multiple level caching, use cache().add().local()

### 7.5.1 (07/23/2020 - 07/31/2020)

* httpClient: remove HTTPClientBuilder.tlsVersions(), jdk 14.0.2 fixed TLSv1.3 issues refer to https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8236039, https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35722
* ide: added javax.annotation.Nullable to improve IDE/Intellij nullability analysis, no runtime impaction.
* ws: update channel interface to be generic typing, only support bean message for client/server
* es: update to 7.8.1

### 7.4.14 (07/13/2020 - 07/23/2020)

* redis: change expiration precision from second to milliseconds
* shutdown: give resources at least 1s to terminate gracefully

### 7.4.12 (06/29/2020 - 07/09/2020)

* cache: support 2 level cache
  !!! with redis configured, cache().local() will be using local + redis 2 levels cache, and using redis channel to notify invalidated keys
  !!! cache().local() should be used in performance sensitive area with high hit rate, to reduce number of redis commands overhead (but to increase JVM GC burden)
  !!! cache().remote() keeps old behavior.
* httpClient: disallowed new HTTPClientBuilder(), use HTTPClient.builder()

### 7.4.11 (06/19/2020 - 06/29/2020)

* es: update to 7.8.0
* ws: reduce warnings on sending message to closed channel (occurs on sending message before channel close listener finish)
* kafka: kafka producer/consumer will be created after startup and wait until kafka uri is resolvable in kube env, this improves recovery time if both kafka and app recreated at same time, and this make kafka has same behavior of other db (mysql/redis/etc)

### 7.4.10 (06/10/2020 - 06/18/2020)

* monitor: tweak kube monitor pod not ready error message
* stats: track jvm_non_heap_used by default
* cache: gracefully handle incompatible json structure from redis, to avoid clearing cache keys manually
* inject: remove method injection support
  !!! from the actual usage, only method injection use case is to do init with dependencies we don't want to put in fields, but generally we prefer calling init method explicitly in modules to make review easier.

### 7.4.9 (06/04/2020 - 06/09/2020)

* http: for static content controllers, convert client abort exception to warning (still better use CDN/Storage solution to serve static resources)

* site: if called site(), then User-Agent and Referrer will be logged in action log context
* kafka: log key in action context for bulk message handler
* db: warning for sql queries not using index or using bad index, for expected queries, use following to disable Database.suppressSlowSQLWarning(true)
  database.select(...)
  Database.suppressSlowSQLWarning(false)
  !!! requires mysql jdbc driver 8.0+, recommend to use same or higher version referred by the framework.
* monitor: fixed kube 1.16 TLSv1.3 issues (workaround to downgrade to TLSv1.2, and wait newer version of JDK)
  refer to https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8236039, https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35722

### 7.4.5 (5/19/2020 - 5/22/2020)

* httpClient: update okHTTP to 4.7.2
* mongo: for unit test, start test mongo server on random port, to avoid multiple tests running on same server

### 7.4.4 (5/13/2020 - 5/18/2020)

* validation: removed @Length, replaced with @Size (now @Size works with string/list/map), to simplify and follow style of javax.validation.constraints
  !!! replace all @Length with @Size
* es: update to 7.7.0
* kafka: added uri parser, to support kafka uri without port (now it doesn't require port in url in all db/kafka/redis/mongo/es)
* httpClient: update okHTTP to 4.7.0

### 7.4.3 (5/8/2020 - 5/13/2020)

* mongo: update driver to 4.0.2
* httpClient: support to trust specific https cert
* http: removed undertow HTTP metrics undertow is using jboss threading and EnhancedQueueExecutor, there is overhead to collect stats with jmx, and they are not critical stats
* redis: start preparing for Redis6/RESP3 (later version may requires redis 6)
* httpClient: update okHTTP to 4.6.0
* httpClient: mask form body param
* monitor: monitor failed pod in kube namespaces
* monitor: support monitor es cluster
  !!! MonitorConfig.es.hosts (list) changes to es.host, only need to connect to one of cluster node to get all nodes info
* es: support cluster to have multiple hosts in SearchConfig.host(host) as comma separated

### 7.4.1.1 (4/24/2020)

* http: improve x-forwarded-for parser to support rfc7239, as Azure AG will use ipv4:port format in x-forwarded-for header
* kafka: rollback kafka client to 2.4.1, java-kafka 2.5.0 client driver causes cpu 100% during startup/rebalance if kafka server is not available or slow
  !!! due to behavior change of org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer.pull -> updateAssignmentMetadataIfNeeded

### 7.4.1 (4/16/2020 - 4/23/2020)

* kafka: update to 2.5.0

* http: update undertow to 2.1.0

### 7.4.0 (4/1/2020 - 4/14/2020) !!! only support java 14

* java: update to java 14, please make sure to upgrade build/jenkins and all docker runtime to 14 before upgrading framework
* http: updated built-in https self sign cert if you encounter chrome error for accessing localhost, open chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost to enable this flag
* crypto: removed AES/RSA/Signature support cryptography is hard to get right and algorithm/best practice changes over time, for cloud env, always to use KMS (gcloud/aws/azure)
  the default impl is not considered as best practice, so we removed it from the framework there is no way to encapsulate simple/non-intrusive API to cover all cases, e.g. with CHACHA20-POLY1305 or AES-GCM, it requires managing and sharing nonce/IV, like either put IV as part of cipher text, or
  share in different channel, and IV should be different every time with RSA or X25519 it still needs to encrypt a symmetric key to encrypt final content
* es: update to 7.6.2
* db: added max operations per action check (default is 5000), to protect bad impl (e.g. infinite loop with db calls) or bad practice (make action too long for zero-down time release)
* db: added errorType (INTEGRITY_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION) in UncheckedSQLException, to support catch duplicate key exception in business logic
* httpClient: update okHTTP to 4.5.0
* http: !!! start http server on https:8443 by default if not specifying sys.http.port and sys.https.port currently all services use https/h2, make sure you set sys.http.port to start http listener if needed, e.g. with Azure AG -> http/8080 website since AG doesn't support self-signed cert make sure
  to update health-check of the latest monitor/log-processor to HTTPS:8443

### 7.3.12.1 (3/25/2020 - 4/1/2020)

* db: added query.in(field, params) shortcut to build dynamic "where in clause"
* log-collector: added param app.cookies to collect specific cookies from request. (this is due to safari expires localStorage and cookies write by js, only way to long term track is thru first party cookie)

### 7.3.11 (3/23/2020 - 3/25/2020)

* kafka: set linger.ms to 5ms by default to improve batching under load

### 7.3.1 (12/20/2019 - 1/15/2020)

* es: update to 7.5.1

* api: updated WebServiceClientInterceptor to support both onRequest/onResponse

### 7.1.8 (11/8/2019 - 11/16/2019)

* http: convert "UT000128: Remote peer closed connection before all data could be read" exception to warn with errorCode=FAILED_TO_READ_HTTP_REQUEST this could be happen in event collector, the browser/app may be terminated before finish sending events, which causes UT000128
* shutdown: allow use env SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_IN_SEC to define shutdown timeout corresponding to kube terminationGracePeriodSeconds, (default is still 25s)

  removed to register Cache<T> with name in CacheConfig, as it's generally for value type
